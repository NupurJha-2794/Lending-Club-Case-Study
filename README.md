# Lending-Club-Case-Study

Problem: Credit loss, incurred when borrowers default on loans, is a significant financial challenge for lending institutions.

Objective: To mitigate credit loss by accurately identifying high-risk loan applicants.

Approach: Employ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key variables or predictors associated with loan default. These insights will inform the development of predictive models and risk assessment strategies.

Goal: Identify and analyze the correlation between borrower characteristics, loan attributes, and loan default status to determine the primary drivers of credit loss.
